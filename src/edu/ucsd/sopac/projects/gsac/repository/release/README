So hopefully you've managed to generated the repository source package.

There are a number of things you need to do.


### Database ###
Change dbresources/gsacdb_test.properties and dbresources/gsacdb_production.properties
to point to your database.
The default is Oracle. 
If you aren't using oracle change the getDriverClassName() method in SopacDatabaseManager



### Code changes ###
The SopacStationManager and SopacResourceManager classes will need to be changed
to implement the queries. See those classes for more details
See the CHANGEME in the comments to see what needs to be changed. 


### HTML ###
Change the resources/header.html & footer.html to the html you want to use for the header and footer


### Building ###
To build run:
ant

The ant build targets will copy one of the db properties files to:
resources/gsacsb.properties

This builds a .zip of a stand-alone gsac server and a .war.
Note: I have not actually tested the war file under Tomcat

To run the server:
ant runserver

You can generate the Tables.java code by running:
ant tables
