gsl:
This is the core GSAC Service Layer implementation

client:
Java based client for accessing a GSAC repository


template:
You can generate a basic gsac repository package.

Copy the example template/macros.properties file to your own file, e.g.:
    cddismacros.properties

Define the target package name, directory, etc., in the properties file

Then run (from this directory, i.e., /src/org/gsac):
ant -propertyfile <your property file> makerepository

This will copy all of the source and resource files and place them in
the specified target directory. 

Now, the hard part... 
You need to actually implement your repository. See the README file in the generated package.
