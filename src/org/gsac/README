GSAC_WS Installation

README, Part 1.

25 March 2013.

This README file describes the first steps in GSAC installation, and is the first of two README files detailing GSAC installation.
This README file is in gsac/trunk/src/org/gsac/ in the GSAC package available from SourceForge as described below.

################################################################################


UNAVCO's GSAC-WS is a software package to provide a complete suite of web services at a geoscience data repository
for data discovery about sites (monuments) and about the GNSS instruments
(antennas and receivers) at the sites, and data access (file downloads).
GSAC provides a web site GUI, an APIi, and a GSAC client program using the API.
GSAC is freely available from SourceForge, as described here.  GSAC was created and is maintained by UNAVCO (www.unavco.org).

GSAC site searches provide details about sites (monuments) and about the GNSS instruments
(antennas and receivers) at the sites, in geodesy formats such as SOPAC XML, SINEX, GAMIT station.info, and others.

You may also provide a download service for RINEX or other GNSS data files.
File download is easy when you already have an FTP service, an FTP URL for each data file to download, and
database records associating file download FTP URLs with the instrument site information in the database and with the
start and end times of data in each file.

The UNAVCO GSAC-WS home page is http://facility.unavco.org/data/gsacws/gsacws.html.  The GSAC Services document,
"UNAVCO GSAC WS: Web Services for Geodesy Data Repositories" (http://facility.unavco.org/data/gsacws/docs/UNAVCO_GSAC_Web_services.pdf)
introduces GSAC in detail and lists requirements to install and run GSACC.  The GSAC User Guide
"UNAVCO GSAC WS: User Guide for GSAC Data Repositories" (http://facility.unavco.org/data/gsacws/UNAVCO_GSAC_User_Guide.pdf)
is for persons using data repositories powered by GSAC.

################################################################################


Installing the UNAVCO GSAC Web Services suite for your data repository.

To install GSAC you need a Linux OS or Mac, with Java 1.6 and the software engineering tools svn (SourceForge), ant, and bash.

You need a database (in MySQL, Postgres, or Oracle) with complete geodesy parameters about sites (monuments) 
and about the GNSS instruments (antennas and receivers) at the sites.


You have done the following already, if you are reading this README file in a GSAC installation:  

Creating the initial GSAC Server

Make a top-level working directory for GSAC, and go there:

mkdir ~/GSAC/
cd    ~/GSAC/

(You can install GSAC code anywhere, so need not make at the new directory GSAC/.)

In the directory where you will install GSAC, such as ~/GSAC/, check out the GSAC code from SourceForge, using this svn (subversion) command:

svn co https://gsac.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gsac gsac

This svn command creates the new subdirectory "gsac" and files under it. 

The download may take as long as 10 or 20 minutes, depending on your Internet conneciton speed.

################################################################################


Build core GSAC code:

Next, cd to the gsac/trunk/src/gsac/trunk/ subdirectory.

Do the command "ant" which builds all the core GSAC code:

ant

This ant command builds the core GSAC code, including the GSL (the GSAC service layer).
The file gsac/trunk/src/gsac/trunk/build.xml is used by this ant command. 'ant' looks for a build.xml file in the working directory.  
This may take two or three minutes. The screen output ends with something like this:

localinit:
init:
war:
     [copy] Copying 1 file to /home/wier/gsac/sourceforge/gsac/trunk/dist
   [delete] Deleting: /home/wier/gsac/sourceforge/gsac/trunk/dist/gsacea1.0/servlet-api.jar
      [war] Building war: /home/wier/gsac/sourceforge/gsac/trunk/dist/gsacws.war
     [echo] ********************************
     [echo] To run the test     server do the command:
     [echo] ant runserver
     [echo] ********************************
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 1 minute 25 seconds

The ant build also will create these items in gsac/trunk/:
build.xml   dist/   examples/   lib/    README  src/
If you investigate you will find dozens of new files and directories below trunk/.

The core GSAC code is files in gsac/trunk/src/org/gsac/ and its subdirectories. 

In general you modify files in the core GSAC code only rarely if ever.  If you do change a file there,
rebuild the GSAC core code with ant in gsac/trunk/.

################################################################################

Center the GSAC Site Map

This is one case when you do modify the GSAC core code checked out from SourceForge.

Site search results from GSAC include a map for the site location, made using OpenLayers. 
To center the map in the latitude-longitude region for your geodesy network:

Edit gsac/trunk/src/org/gsac/gsl/htdocs/repositorymap.js

Set the longitude, latitude, and zoom level for the center of your map in the lines:
/*   center of GSAC map  or viewpoint: */

/*   center of GSAC site map,  in US lower 48 states, with longitude, latitude */
//var defaultLocation = new OpenLayers.LonLat(-104, 40);

/*   default map center longitude, latitude: Royal Observatory, Greenwich, U.K. */
var defaultLocation = new OpenLayers.LonLat(0.000, 51.4772);


Set the zoom level in the lines:
/*   GSAC map of sites; set zoom level; 3 is about 10 000 km wide; 4 is about 3900 km wide. */
var defaultZoomLevel = 4;


For more about OpenLayers maps, see for example http://trac.osgeo.org/openlayers/wiki/SettingZoomLevels.

Core GSAC code

 do 

cd src/org/gsac/  

The full path to src/org/gsac/, such as ~/gsac/sourceforge/gsac/trunk/src/org/gsac, is not shown in commands here.

What's in src/org/gsac/:
 
   build.xml  used by ant 

   client/  The code files for the Java-based client program for accessing a GSAC repository using its API (not the web site).

   federated/ This is the implemention of the federated repository

   gsl/ This directory has the core GSAC Service Layer implementation files.

   package.html for the web pages

   ramadda/ The files for the RAMADDA GSAC plugin, for the RAMADDA content management system.

   README   Part 1 for GSAC installation

   template/  see below:

################################################################################


Generating Your Initial GSAC-WS repository package

The template directory (src/org/gsac/template/) holds template files for the initial GSAC repository package 
implementation. This allows you to generate a package with all of the boilerplate Java code and build scripts.

What you need to do next is define a set of macro values that are used to take the code in the 
template/ package and make an initial GSAC.

Copy the example template/macros.properties file to your own file with a similar name, e.g.:

cd template/
cp macros.properties   myrepomacros.properties

'myrepo' is only a placeholder here, in these instructions.  Replace the 'myrepo' with an approprite name for your agency, project, or repository. 

Edit the new properties file to define the target package name, directory, etc.  
(Do not use a copy of an existing macros.properties file without the following edits.)

For example:

##Name you want for the repository
target.name=myrepo GSAC Repository

##This is used to create the jar and Tomcat's ".war" release file names. Often begins with the 4 characters "gsac," and ends with your acronym.
target.basename=gsacmyrepo

##target Java package name.  Replace the 'myrepo' part with your acronym, and retain the org. and .gsac parts:
target.package=org.myrepo.gsac

##All of the java classes will have this prefix as the first part of their names. Usually your acronym. Capitalize first letter, a Java class naming convention.
target.prefix=Ring

# What database driver jar file do we use? (This gets added to the generated build.xml to include the right jar file from Java for db access.)
target.dbdriver=mysql.jar

Other choices for the database driver jar file are postgres.jar and oracleDriver.jar.  Use the one for your database.

Then 

cd ../ 

to src/org/gsac/

and run this ant command in src/org/gsac/, replacing the 'myrepomacros.properties' file name with your file name:

            ant -propertyfile template/myrepomacros.properties makerepository   

The final lines output to screen should be like:
init:
copyjava:
     [copy] Copying 1 file to ~/gsac/sourceforge/gsac/trunk/src/org/myrepo/gsac
     [echo] Repository source package has been created
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Totaltest2013a time: 1 second

The 'myrepomacros.properties' file is only used one time.

This ant makerepository process copies GSAC source and resource file templates to new directories and files, replacing the macros with
the values you defined in myrepomacros.properties, into the specified new target directory tree, such as src/org/myrepo/.

Also, the template file for the second or Part 2 README file, org/gsac/template/README, has been extended and copied to your new package, for example, 
to src/org/myrepo/gsac/README, and it has the next set of instructions for you to follow to complete your GSAC installation.  

Follow the instructions in your new GSAC code area, like src/org/myrepo/gsac/README, the Part 2 README.
