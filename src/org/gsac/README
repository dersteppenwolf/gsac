GSAC-WS Installation

README, Part 1.  Creating the Initial GSAC Server at your repository

September 12, 2013.  SKW UNAVCO

UNAVCO's GSAC is a package of code for web services. With GSAC a geodesy or geophysics data center can quickly offer a set of complete, 
consistent, modern web services for remote users to query the data center about stations and instruments, and download data files. 

The UNAVCO GSAC-WS home page is at http://facility.unavco.org/data/gsacws/gsacws.html.  If you plan to install GSAC, first read
the GSAC Intallation page, http://facility.unavco.org/data/gsacws/gsac-install.html.

The GSAC Web Services document, "UNAVCO GSAC WS: Web Services for Geodesy Data Repositories" (http://facility.unavco.org/data/gsacws/docs/UNAVCO_GSAC_Web_services.pdf)
introduces GSAC in detail.  The GSAC User Guide "UNAVCO GSAC WS: User Guide for GSAC Data Repositories" (http://facility.unavco.org/data/gsacws/UNAVCO_GSAC_User_Guide.pdf)
is for persons using data repositories powered by GSAC.

This README file describes the first steps in GSAC installation once you have the necessary software resources described in the GSAC Intallation page, 
and is the first of two README files detailing GSAC installation.  This file is in gsac-code/src/org/gsac/ in the GSAC package available from SourceForge as described below.

Installation of GSAC requires some Java coding described in README part 2.  It is not possible for GSAC core code to anticipate
the design of data repositories or what data values and files are available or of interest for you to
offer online.  New code is needed to adapt GSAC to your database and possibly to other system features at your
data repository.  Users may need to correspond with UNAVCO if they want to have a successful installation. 
Contact UNAVCO at gsac-ws@unavco.org to request software support.

Quick Install, Part 1.  Creating the initial GSAC Server at your repository

For experienced GSAC operators and software engineers.

Find or make a top-level working directory for GSAC, and go there. For example:

mkdir ~/GSAC/

cd    ~/GSAC/

Check out the GSAC code from SourceForge (go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/gsac/; 
    and click on 'Code' menu item in 'Summary Files ...' menu line, to get the command).

by entering this command:

svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/gsac/code/trunk gsac-code

cd to  gsac-code/

Do an intial ant build with the command:

ant

Edit gsac-code/src/org/gsac/gsl/htdocs/repositorymap.js to set the longitude, latitude, and zoom level for the center of your map in the lines:
The value defaultZoomLevel = 4 will show all of western Europe; 6 will show an area about 1200 km wide by 800 km high. 

  var defaultLocation = new OpenLayers.LonLat(14.15, 48.5);
  var defaultZoomLevel = 5;

Rebuild the GSAC core code with command 'ant', executed in ~/GSAC/gsac-code/.  You may find the screen messages interesting to show the 
process of a GSAC build. 

cd to gsac-code/src/org/gsac/template/

cp macros.properties   myrepomacros.properties  //  replace "myrepo" in the new file name with an appropriate name for your repository.

Edit the new myrepomacros.properties file to set:

target.name=Myrepo GSAC Repository
target.basename=gsacmyrepo     // used in Java package name and for the new directory for your new GSAC code files.
target.package=org.myrepo.gsac // The Java package name. If not beginning with org, see notes below for the Java package name.
target.prefix=Myrepo           // used in names of Java files. Java style has first letter in uppper case, only.
target.dbdriver=mysql.jar      // or postgres.jar or oracleDriver.jar; which db server type you use.

Then

cd ../   

to src/org/gsac/. Then run a command like this, with the new macros.properties file name:

ant -propertyfile template/myrepomacros.properties makerepository   

Look to be sure no errors are sent to the screen.  This process creates a new code area, something line
gsac-code/src/org/myrepo/gsac/, and populates it with initial coding files for your GSAC repository.

cd to the just-made new directory with new GSAC code just for your repository, such as gsac-code/src/org/myrepo/gsac/. 

Follow the README file there to complete your GSAC installation. That is README Part 2. 

(end of quick install README Part 1).

################################################################################

UNAVCO's GSAC-WS is a software package to provide a complete suite of web services at a geoscience data repository
for data discovery about sites (monuments) and about the GNSS instruments (antennas and receivers) at the sites, 
and about data access (file downloads).  GSAC provides a web site GUI, an HTTP or RESTful API, and a GSAC client program using the API.
GSAC is freely available from SourceForge, as described here.  GSAC was created and is maintained by UNAVCO (www.unavco.org).

GSAC site searches provide details about sites (monuments) and about the GNSS instruments (antennas and receivers) at the sites, 
in geodesy formats such as SINEX, GAMIT station.info, SOPAC XML and others.  You may also provide a download service for RINEX 
and other type of geodesy data files.  GSAC may be used to provide web services for any science data repository with information in a database about instrumented stations
at fixed locations and about data files from the instruments.

################################################################################


To install GSAC you need  

>   a database, with complete metadata about sites(stations), their instruments, and their data files (if any). GSAC presently can read Oracle, Postgres, or MySQL. 
    You can use an existing database you have, with no changes to it but some changes will be needed to GSAC code to use your database table and field names. 
    Or you can make a new database using the GSAC prototype MySQL database schema, populating it with your data values.

>   usually, but optionally, data files from the instruments. GSAC can provide discovery and download of geodesy data files (like RINEX files), if you have an FTP / HTTP download service set up for the data files.
    File download is easy when you already have an FTP service, with an FTP URL for each data file to download in database records associating file download FTP URLs with the 
    instrument site information (also in the database), and with the start and end times of data in each file.

>   a web server for GSAC web pages. Running GSAC with the Tomcat application server is common, but Tomcat is optional. GSAC can use its own (included) application server, Jetty.

>   the GSAC software package provided by UNAVCO. GSAC is free and open source code in the GSAC package from SourceForge.

>   A Linux system for code development, with related software tools (bash, Java 1.6, svn, and ant), and with access to your GSAC database and web server.


################################################################################


Check out GSAC code from SourceForge

You may have done the following already, if you are reading this README file in a GSAC installation:  

Find or make a top-level working directory for GSAC, and go there. For example:
mkdir ~/GSAC/
cd    ~/GSAC/

(You can install GSAC code anywhere, so you need not make a new directory GSAC/.)

In the directory where you will install GSAC, such as ~/GSAC/, check out the GSAC code from SourceForge, using this svn (subversion) command:
(Go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/gsac/; and click on 'Code' menu item in 'Summary Files ...' menu line, to get the command below.)

svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/gsac/code/trunk gsac-code

cd to  gsac-code/

This svn command creates the new subdirectory "gsac-code" and files under it. 

The download may take as long as 20 minutes, depending on your Internet connection speed.

################################################################################


Build core GSAC code:

Next, cd to  ~/GSAC/gsac-code/,  your GSAC files area.

Do the command "ant" which builds all the core GSAC code:

ant

(ant uses the build.xml in its directory, and may use other build.xml files further down the directory tres, such as the file  gsac-code/org/src/gsac/build.xml.)

This ant command builds the core GSAC code, including the GSL, the GSAC service layer.  

This may take one to three minutes. Watch for errors sent to the screen.  The screen output ends with something like this:

localinit:
init:
war:
     [copy] Copying 1 file to /home/mydir/gsac/gsac-code/dist
   [delete] Deleting:         /home/mydir/gsac/gsac-code/dist/gsacea1.0/servlet-api.jar
      [war] Building war: /home/mydir/gsac/gsac-code/dist/gsacws.war
     [echo] ********************************
     [echo] To run the test     server do the command:
     [echo] ant runserver
     [echo] ********************************
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 1 minute 25 seconds

The ant build also will create these items in gsac-code/:
build.xml   dist/   examples/   lib/    README  src/
If you investigate you will find dozens of new files and directories below gsac-code/.

The core GSAC code is files in gsac-code/src/org/gsac/ and its subdirectories. 

Building core GSAC code makes the .jar file gsac-code/lib/gsacws.jar (and other things).
The file gsacws.jar holds all the core GSAC code.  When you build code for your local GSAC, described in README part 2, the core GSAC code is
imported or included in the gsacws.war file.  

In general you modify files in the core GSAC code only rarely if ever.  If you change a file there,
rebuild the GSAC core code with command ant in gsac-code/. Then rebuild your GSAC code
with ant in your GSAC area, if you have made the GSAC code particular to your repository.

(If you later change code, or get new files with an svn update for
new core GSAC code made by others (not already in your own personal GSAC), you need to do ant in gsac-code/ again to rebuild the core GSAC package.
Then rebuild your GSAC with ant in your lcoal directory area, as described below.)

Contact UNAVCO if you have or need changes to core GSAC code, such as format changes in an output ("GSAC results") file.

################################################################################

Center the GSAC Site Map

There is one routine case when you modify GSAC core code checked out from SourceForge.
Site search results from GSAC include a map for the site location. The map is made using OpenLayers. 
The default map in GSAC shows (at this time) almost all of western Europe, east to Moscow and Turkey.

To center the map in the latitude-longitude region for your geodesy network, edit 

gsac-code/src/org/gsac/gsl/htdocs/repositorymap.js

Set the longitude, latitude, and zoom level for the center of your map in the lines:

/*   center of GSAC map  or viewpoint, with longitude, latitude: */
/*   current GSAC default map center longitude, latitude:  14.15 E 48.5 N */
var defaultLocation = new OpenLayers.LonLat(14.15, 48.5);

Set the zoom level in the lines:

/*   GSAC map of sites; set zoom level: 3 is about 10,000 km wide; 4 is about 3900 km wide. */
var defaultZoomLevel = 4;

For more about OpenLayers maps, see for example http://trac.osgeo.org/openlayers/wiki/SettingZoomLevels.

Rebuild the GSAC core code with command ant in gsac-code/trunk/.  


################################################################################


The GSAC Core Code

Core GSAC code is in ~/GSAC/gsac-code/src/org/gsac/  

The full path including for example ~/GSAC/gsac-code/src/org/, is not shown in all commands here.

What's in src/org/gsac/:
 
   build.xml  used by ant 

   client/  The code files for the Java-based client program for accessing a GSAC repository using its API

   federated/ This is the implemention of the federated repository

   gsl/ This directory has the core GSAC Service Layer implementation files

   package.html for the web pages

   ramadda/ The files for the RAMADDA GSAC plugin, for the RAMADDA content management system (not described here)

   README   Part 1 for GSAC installation  (the file you are reading)

   template/  see the next section. 

################################################################################


Generating Your Initial GSAC-WS repository package

The template directory (org/gsac/template/) holds template files for the initial GSAC repository package 
implementation. This allows you to generate a new GSAC instance or package with all of the boilerplate Java code and build scripts.

What you need to do next is define a set of macro values that are used to take files in 
org/gsac/template/ and make an initial collection of code for your new GSAC data repository.

Copy the example org/gsac/template/macros.properties file to your own file with a similar name, e.g.:

cd to org/gsac/template/

cp macros.properties   myrepomacros.properties

'myrepo' is only a placeholder in this README file.  You replace "myrepo" with an appropriate name for your agency, project, or repository. 

Edit the new properties file to define the target package name, directory, etc.  For example:

##Name you want for the repository
target.name=Myrepo GSAC Repository

##This is used to create the jar and Tomcat's ".war" release file names. Often begins with the 4 characters "gsac," and ends with your acronym.
target.basename=gsacmyrepo

##target Java package name.  Replace the 'myrepo' part with your acronym, and retain the org. and .gsac parts:
target.package=org.myrepo.gsac

(You may wish to choose a top-level Java package name other than "org."  For example, if you wish to have the top level be "de", 
first make a new subdirectory gsac-code/src/de/.  Then in your  macros.properties file use 
target.package=de.myrepo.gsac
You may use longer package names, such as the GSAC package at edu.ucsd.sopac.projects.gsac.repository from SOPAC at the University of California San Diego.
)

A correct target.package name is important.  It determines the directories where your GSAC code is stored.  If there is an error in the target.package
the files will be in the wrong place in the GSAC tree and your code will not compile or build correctly. Do not put your package in the core area src/org/gsac/.

##All of the Java classes will have this prefix as the first part of their names, usually your acronym. Capitalize the first letter, a Java class naming convention.
target.prefix=Myrepo

# What database driver jar file do you use? (This gets added to the generated build.xml to include the right jar file from Java for db access.)
target.dbdriver=mysql.jar

Other choices for the database driver jar file, mysql.jar, are postgres.jar and oracleDriver.jar.  Use the one for your database.


Create initial code for new repository

cd ../ to src/org/gsac/

and run this ant command, replacing the 'myrepomacros.properties' file name with the name of your new properties file:

ant -propertyfile template/myrepomacros.properties makerepository   


The final lines output to screen from ant should be like:
init:
copyjava:
     [copy] Copying 1 file to ~/gsac/gsac-code/src/org/myrepo/gsac
     [echo] Repository source package has been created
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 1 second

The 'myrepomacros.properties' file is only used this one time.

This ant makerepository process copies GSAC source and resource file templates to new directories and files, replacing the macros with
the values you defined in myrepomacros.properties, into the specified new package's directory tree, such as org/myrepo/.   This is 
somewhat parallel to the core GSAC code files in org/gsac/.


################################################################################


GSAC Code for a new Repository

After you created your myrepomacros.properties file, cd to the new directory with your GSAC code, such as 
~/GSAC/gsac-code/src/org/myrepo/gsac.  This is determined by your package name.  

(In the GSAC README files the path to your GSAC code is given as src/org/myrepo/, but your real path may not even have "org" of course. It could be
something like this ficticious path fr/paris-sorbonne/geocentre/projets/gsac/repository/. )

For a new implementation called myrepo, there are new files like these in the top directory with your GSAC code: 

   9851 2013-02-13 11:38 build.xml
   4096 2013-02-13 11:38 dbresources
    520 2013-02-13 11:38 gsacrepository.bat
    802 2013-02-13 11:38 gsacrepository.sh
    779 2013-02-13 11:38 package.html
  38199 2013-02-13 11:38 README
   4096 2013-02-13 11:38 release
   4096 2013-02-13 11:38 resources
   2046 2013-02-13 11:38 MyrepoDatabaseManager.java
   5299 2013-02-13 11:38 MyrepoFileManager.java
   2443 2013-02-13 11:38 MyrepoRepository.java
   1666 2013-02-13 11:38 MyrepoServer.java
  11231 2013-02-13 11:38 MyrepoSiteManager.java
   3440 2013-02-13 11:38 MyrepoTest.java

The new README file is README, Part 2, for your repository.  It has the next set of instructions for you to follow to complete your GSAC installation.  

Follow the instructions in the README the top directory with your GSAC code.

################################################################################

Build a Federated GSAC:

(NOT done as part of a GSAC to offer web services for your local data repository)


To install a federated GSAC, a single GSAC server which merges searches and results from
two or more other GSAC repositories, modify the file

gsac-code/src/org/gsac/federated/resources/gsacserver.properties

You connect to other GSACs in the file:

# Server info
gsac.server.hostname=repodev.unavco.org
gsac.server.port=80

#The list of remote server ids we are using

#For each of these the federated repository looks for:
#gsac.federated.<id>.url=base gsac url
#gsac.federated.<id>.name=repository name
#gsac.federated.<id>.icon=url to icon for the repository
