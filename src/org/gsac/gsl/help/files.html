<h2>GSAC File Searches and Results</h2>

The Search Files form lets you search for instrument data files using several parameters.  
<br>You can also select on sites which have the files you want.
</p>

<p>
Here is part of a typical GSAC Search Files form. In this example the 
<b>Data Date</b> range is for the first day in October 2012, and the <b>Site Query</b> option is 
used to search for files from a station named PALM.
Most search choices are optional; use the ones which suit your needs.

<p>
Clicking on the <b>Site:</b> name brings up the normal page of information about this site from GSAC.
</p>

<p>
Clicking on the <b>URL:</b> does the normal response to clicking on a URL in your browser; it may show a page of text or may
prompt for a file download from the URL.

<p>
Note that you must have FTP server running on your web site with complete information about the file location in
your database for GSAC and FTP access.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Back on the main file results table, clicking on a name in the <b>Site</b> column brings up the normal page of information about this site from GSAC.
</p>

<p>
On the main file results table, clicking on 
<b>Wget Script</b> gives you a shell file "gascwget.sh" which has one or more lines, each line a wget command to download 
the files in the results table you are looking at.  Such as
<br>
wget ftp://data-out.unavco.org/pub/rinex/qc/2012/274/palm2740.12S
<br>
wget ftp://data-out.unavco.org/pub/rinex/obs/2012/274/palm2740.12d.Z
<br>
wget ftp://data-out.unavco.org/pub/rinex/nav/2012/274/palm2740.12n.Z
</p>

<p>
Note this wget script file will download <i>all</i> the files in the output page, which for some searches is hundreds of files.
One line from the wget script file will download one file.
</p>


<p>
On the main file results table, clicking on 
<b>Download files</b> gives you a  file "files.jnlp" to download all the files using Java Webstart.
