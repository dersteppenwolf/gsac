<h3>GSAC Overview</h3>

The GSAC repository interface allows you to search and browse for GNSS sites and data files. 
Because there are a number of different GSAC repository implementations the specific site and data
file queries that you can make may differ between repositories.

<h3>Result Formats</h3>
Normally when you query a GSAC repository the results are returned as HTML. However, there are a number of output 
formats available listed under the &quot;Results&quot; section of the search form. For example, there are CSV and JSON 
formats for site search results. For data files there is a file downloader available (requires Java Webstart)
as well as output formats listing the URLs, zipping the data files, etc.
