<h2>Search Sites </h2>


The Search Sites form  lets you search for sites with instruments, using several parameters.
You can search for sites by name, in a latitude-longitude bounding box, dates, and with many other choices.  The items to query on are chosen when a new GSAC is implemented, from among fields (columns) in the database which the GSAC reads.
</p>

<p>
Here is part of a typical GSAC  Search Sites form.

<p>
The free form text search fields (e.g., &quot;4 Char ID&quot;,  &quot;Site Name&quot;) support wildcarding with &quot;*&quot;. So, for example, in the above image the search will result in any sites that begin with &quot;P&quot;.
You can of course search for a single site, by name.
</p>

<p>
You can search with other search criteria, including typically date ranges and  geographic bounds. The bounds are specified with a north latitude / west longitude / east longitude / south latitude. West Longitude may be negative, or may be simply a smaller positive longitude than the east latitude.
</p>

<p>
You can easily switch to the Search Files form. Click on the "File Search Form" icon. All site search criteria
specified to Search Sites will be  included in the  Search Files form.

<h3>Advanced Site Query (Search)</h3>
The Advanced Site Query or search options can be opened to select other search criteria.
Here are some (not all) from the UNAVCO GSAC:

By default the results are a web page  ("Site HTML") with a table of sites' information.

<p>Other formats include:
<ul>
<li>SOPAC XML Site Log format.  See http://sopac.ucsd.edu/projects/xml/. 
<li>SINEX format is described in the IERS SINEX Format page,

<li>GAMIT station.info file, described in the GAMIT documents page, http://www.gpsg.mit.edu/~simon/gtgk/docs.htm.
<li>a file in csv (comma separated value) format, with geodesy parameter values for a site.
<li>a file in plain text format with with geodesy parameter values for a site; this format was created by UNAVCO solely for GSAC use, only for a quick visual check of what is available. The plain text file is not for computer processing and UNAVCO GSAC may alter its format at any time without notification.
