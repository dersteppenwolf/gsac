<h2>GSAC Site Search</h2>


The Site search form may contain different fields depending on 
which GSAC repository you are viewing but they typically look like
this:
<br>
<center class="gsac-helpimg"><img src="images/sites.jpg"></center>


<h3>Free Text Search</h3>
The free form text search fields (e.g., &quot;4 Char ID&quot;,  &quot;Site Name&quot;) support wildcarding with &quot;*&quot;. So, for example, in the above image the search will result in any sites that begin with &quot;P12&quot;.


<h3>Spatial Search</h3>

You can select other search criteria including spatial bounds. The spatial bounds are specified with a north/west/east/south or you can select them in a map view.

<h3>Advanced Search</h3>
The Advanced Site Query can be opened to select other search criteria.


<h3>Result Format</h3>

can return site search results in a number of formats, e.g., HTML (the default), Google Earth KML, CSV, etc.


<h3>File Search</h3> 
You can easily switch to the File Search form. Any site search criteria
specified in the form will be used in the File Search form.
