<h2>Search Sites </h2>


The Search Sites form  lets you search for sites with instruments, using several parameters.
You can search for sites by name, in a latitude-longitude bounding box, dates, and with many other choices.  The items to query on are chosen when a new GSAC is implemented, from among fields (columns) in the database which the GSAC reads.
</p>

<p>
Here is part of a typical GSAC  Search Sites form.

<p>
The free form text search fields (e.g., &quot;4 Char ID&quot;,  &quot;Site Name&quot;) support wildcarding with &quot;*&quot;. So, for example, in the above image the search will result in any sites that begin with &quot;P&quot;.
You can of course search for a single site, by name.
</p>

<p>
You can search with other search criteria, including typically date ranges and  geographic bounds. The bounds are specified with a north latitude / west longitude / east longitude / south latitude. West Longitude may be negative, or may be simply a smaller positive longitude than the east latitude.
</p>

<p>
You can easily switch to the Search Files form. Click on the "File Search Form" icon. All site search criteria
specified to Search Sites will be  included in the  Search Files form.

<h3>Advanced Site Query (Search)</h3>

By default the results are a web page  ("Site HTML") with a table of sites' information.
"XML Site Log" is an XML file conforming to the SOPAC XML site log format.  You can also get results in 
a csv file or as JSON.  The agency providing the GSAC respositroy must have implemented these choices.

The table of site search results on a web page looks like:

Clicking on an item in the  <b>4 Char ID</b> column brings up a web page about that site.
