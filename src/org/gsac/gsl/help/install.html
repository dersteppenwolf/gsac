<h2>Installing GSAC-WS</h2>


<P> <B>What is needed for a GSAC-WS Repository at Your Agency?</b></p>

<P>
GSAC-WS is free, open source code, provided by UNAVCO.

<P>
What You Need
</p>
<ul>
<li>
a database, with complete metadata about sites(stations), their instruments, and their data files (if any). GSAC presently can read Oracle, Postgres, or MySQL. You can use an existing database you have, with no changes to it but some changes will be needed to GSAC code to use your database table and field names. Or you can make a new database using the GSAC prototype MySQL database schema (as described below), populating it with your data values.
<p><li>
usually, but optionally, data files from the instruments. GSAC can provide discovery and download of geodesy data files (like RINEX files), if you have an FTP / HTTP download service set up for the data files.
<p><li>
a web server for GSAC web pages. Running GSAC with the Tomcat application server is common, but Tomcat is optional. GSAC can use its own (included) application server, Jetty. 
<p><li>
the GSAC software package provided by UNAVCO. GSAC is free and open source code in the GSAC package from SourceForge. 
<p><li>
A Linux system for code development, with related software tools (bash, Java 1.6, svn, and ant), and with access to your GSAC database and web server. 
</ul>

<P>
If these items are present, and conventionally configured, you should be able to run a GSAC-enabled  data repository. 

<p>
To begin to install GSAC, see first the report 
<a href="http://facility.unavco.org/data/gsacws/docs/UNAVCO_GSAC_Web_services.pdf">UNAVCO GSAC WS: Web Services for Geodesy Data Repositories</a>. 
The section "Installing GSAC," tells how to begin GSAC installation, and tells where to find the two README files to complete installation, in the GSAC software package. Once you have gotten the GSAC code from SourceForge, complete installation instructions are in the two README files in the code package. This ensures that installation help is in sync with the code package.
