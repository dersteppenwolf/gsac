GSAC-WS is a package for comprehensive user access to archives of geodetic data including GPS/GNSS.
GSAC provides a web browser-based UI for data search, data file downloading, and a web services REST API.
There is also a GSAC command line client, a Java-based client program for accessing a GSAC repository through its API,
that allows users to do programmatic searches of a GSAC repository and to download files.
